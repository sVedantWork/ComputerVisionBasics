# ComputerVisionBasics
Using the simple implementation of libraries such as Mediapipe and OpenCv as well as  elementary level python, I've created a few fun projects with the guidance of FreeCodeCamp and other rescources.

# PreRequisites:
1] Medium quialty webcam.
2] Laptop/ PC Screen as the display window is 1280 x 720


# Instructions for running the program:
I've created and implemented this program using pycharm professional, this can be done using other IDEs as well.    
* 1] Install OpenCv using instructions: https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html.    
* 2] Pull all the files in the same folder, unzip PainterHeaders.zip and run the Painter.py  
* 3] Raise index and middle fingers of one hand adjacent and touching each other to select specific colors or the eraser.  
* 4] After selecting a color, make a fist with your hand and then just raise the index finger of any one hand to draw in the display window.   
* 5] Enjoy Drawing :)
