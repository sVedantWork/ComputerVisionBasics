# ComputerVisionBasics
Using the simple implementation of libraries such as Mediapipe and OpenCv as well as  elementary level python, I've created a few fun projects with the guidance of FreeCodeCamp and other rescources.

# PreRequisites:
* 1] Medium quialty webcam.
* 2] Laptop/ PC Screen as the display window is 1280 x 720
* 3] Elementary understanding of python.
* 4] Make sure the palm is always facing the webcam and parallel to it to get the best results.

# AI_PAINTER: 
I've made a AI painter wherein using the index finger we can draw on the display window with 4 different color options. 
# Instructions for running the program:
I've created and implemented this program using pycharm professional, this can be done using other IDEs as well.    
* 1] Install OpenCv using instructions: https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html.    
* 2] Pull all the files in the same folder {HandTrackingBasics_Module.py & AI_Painter.py}, unzip PainterHeaders.zip and run the Painter.py  
* 3] Raise index and middle fingers of one hand adjacent and touching each other to select specific colors or the eraser.  
* 4] After selecting a color, make a fist with your hand and then just raise the index finger of any one hand to draw in the display window.   
* 5] Enjoy Drawing :)  

# AI_MOUSE: 
I've made an AI_Mouse which uses hand tracking mechanism to track the index finger to move the mouse accordingly and clicks when mouse and
index finger of the same hand are touching each either.

* 2] Pull all the required files in the same folder {HandTrackingBasics_Module.py & AI_Virtual_Mouse.py}
* 3] Play around with the mouse and have fun :)

# VOLUME_CONTROL:
I've made a Voulme Gesture Control which uses hand tracking mechanism to track the index finger and thumb and based on the distance between the two fingers it increases and decreases the volume of the laptop accordingly.
* 1] Install OpenCv using instructions: https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html.    
* 2] Pull all the required files in the same folder {VolumeHandControl.py & HandTrackingBasics_Module.py}
* 3] As the distance between the fingers increases the volume increases and vice versa.
* 4] Play around and have fun :)
